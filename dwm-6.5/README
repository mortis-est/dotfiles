This is my personal configuration of dwm
========================================
The following patches have been applied:
- autostart
- exitmenu
- fullgaps

In addition to this, the X11/XF86keysym.h 
header file has been included into the main
configuration to facilitate adjusting the
monitor's brightness. Bindings have also 
been modified to mimic those of i3.
